# InterviewSheduler

http://127.0.0.1:8000/interview/Select-time-slot/
Can use this api for candidates/interviewers to register their available time slots in app


Let us know if there are any assumptions you made while solving this problem.

Second could able to create the second api properly ,Tried to create but had some issues while creating it within this time period.Couldn't able to debug few errors
in the api endpoints.
For your reference (https://github.com/rohithrkrishnan177/interviewing__Project) which is partially working 
(Write another API which will return interview schedulable time slots as a list which will
take candidate id and interviewer id as input.)


Can you suggest a better solution to the above mentioned interview scheduling
problem?

--> By using advance technologies like artifical intilligence ,Machine Learning we can completely remove the interviewer part form this task and hence in result
    we can simply neglect a human interviewer and we can interview the cantidate with the Bot we created. We can record their answer and and evaluate the way they
    appear on interviews.We can even evaluate the facial expressions , Emotion  on the cantidate more evective way and we only need to have the cantiate's convinent 
    time.
    
If you had some more time how would you improve your solution?

-->Definitely i will able to complete the second api as well.In addition to that i will try to add different modules for different stackholders
 and can  authentication techniques. And also can add a function to send notification of the interview status and timing to both interviewer and cantidated accordingly.
